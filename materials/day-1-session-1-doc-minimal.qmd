# Overview

## Levels of package documentation

-   Metadata: The `DESCRIPTION` file -- "what's in this package?"

-   Object documentation: for functions and data

<!-- for each of the exported functions and datasets in the package, along with examples of usage -->

-   Vignettes: Long form documentation

<!-- generally discussing how to use a number of functions from the - package together and/or how a package fits into a larger ecosystem of packages -->

-   pkgdown sites: Websites for your package!


# `DESCRIPTION`

## Sample `DESCRIPTION`

🎬 Take a look at the `DESCRIPTION` for the following packages. What's common? What's different?

-   **`ggplot2`** 
    -   [CRAN Package page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html)
    -   [DESCRIPTION on GitHub](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/main/DESCRIPTION)

-   **`palmerpenguins`** 
    -   [CRAN Package page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/palmerpenguins/index.html)
    -   [DESCRIPTION on GitHub](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/blob/master/DESCRIPTION)




## Metadata in `DESCRIPTION` 

-   Title: One line, title case, with no period. Fewer than 65 characters.

-   Version

    -   for release: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version.
    -   for development version building on version MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, use: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.9000

-   Authors\@R: 
    -  "aut" means author, "cre" means creator, "ctb" means contributor.


## Update `DESCRIPTION`

🎬 Add a title 

\

🎬 Add yourself as an author and creator.





## Metadata in `DESCRIPTION` 

-   Description: One paragraph describing what the package does. Keep the width of the paragraph to 80 characters; indent subsequent lines with 4 spaces.

-   License

-   Encoding: How to encode text, use UTF-8 encoding.

-   LazyData: Use true to lazy-load data sets in the package.


# Object documentation


## Object documentation

Object documentation is what you see when you use `?` or `help()` to find out more about a function or a dataset in a package.

We will create object documentation using Roxygen comments, which start with #'

Much of the work is done by the `roxygen2` package, but we won't directly run `roxygen2` functions, but instead run functions from devtools that call them

## Object documentation workflow

-   Add roxygen comments to your .R files.

-   Run `devtools::document()` to convert roxygen comments to .Rd files.

-   Load the current version of the package with `devtools::load_all()`

-   Preview documentation with `?`

-   Rinse and repeat until the documentation looks the way you want.

## Document your function

🎬 Open `uss_make_matches.R`

🎬 Go to Code \> Insert Roxygen Documentation

🎬 Fill in the documentation: Give your function a title, then, in a new paragraph, a brief description, define the two parameters, and finally, describe what the function returns

🎬 Save `uss_make_matches.R`, run `devtools::document()` followed by `devtools::load_all()`

🎬 Preview the documentation with `uss_make_matches` and edit your documentation if anything needs to be changed

## Add examples

🎬 Under `@examples`, add one example for using your function

🎬 Save `uss_make_matches.R`, run `devtools::document()` followed by `devtools::load_all()`

🎬 Preview the documentation with `?uss_make_matches` and edit your documentation if anything needs to be changed
