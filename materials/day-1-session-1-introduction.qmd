# üëã Welcome

## Introductions

This is a two-day, hands-on workshop for those who have embraced the tidyverse and want to build their own packages.

-   Have you written a few of your own R functions?
-   Are you ready to start sharing your code (or data) through R packages?
-   Are you curious what you can do to make your first R packages easy for your users to use, and for you to maintain?

# Why make a package?

## Why make a package

## Script vs package

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
### Script

-   one-off data analysis
-   defined by `.R` extension
-   `library()` calls
-   documentation in \# comments
-   `source()`
:::

::: {.column width="65%"}
### Package

-   defines reusable components
-   defined by presence of `DESCRIPTION` file
-   Required packages specified in `DESCRIPTION`, made available in `NAMESPACE` file
-   documentation in files and `Roxygen` comments
-   Install and restart

# Where packages come from and live?

## Where do R packages come from?

CRAN:

```{r}
install.packages("praise")
```

GitHub:

```{r}
remotes::install_github("rladies/praise")
```

Bioconductor

```{r}
BiocManager::install("celaref")
```

## Where do packages live?

In a library! In

```{r}
#| eval: true
R.home()
```

The R home directory is the top-level directory of your R installation.

Note: this is **not** the same as your working directory or your home directory.

## Your R installation

```{r}
#| eval: true
list.files(R.home())
```

## Your library

```{r}
#| eval: true
.Library
```

## Your library

```{r}
#| eval: true
dir(.Library)
```

# Explore a package

## The ussie package

Where we are going. discuss some of the files

# Package states

## Package states

There are five states a package can be in:

-   source

-   bundled

-   binary

-   installed

-   in-memory

::: aside
Having a understanding of the different states a package can be helpful in understanding package development.

If a package is installed, `library()` makes its function available by loading the package into memory and attaching it to the search path.

We do not use `library()` for packages we are working on

`devtools::load_all()` loads a source package directly into memory.

# Create a package!

## Create a package

We will create a version controlled package called **`ussie`** with a remote repo on GitHub.

\

. . .

**`ussie`** will allow you to work with European football league data supplied by the **`engsoccerdata`** package @engsoccerdata

\

. . .

The CRAN version of **`engsoccerdata`** has data from the start of the league until 2016 for `england`, `germany`, `holland`, `italy` and `spain`

\

. . .

BUT the format of the data is **not** the same for all countries!!

## About **`engsoccerdata`** {.smaller}

```{r}
#| eval: true
dplyr::glimpse(engsoccerdata::england)
```
\


```{r}
#| eval: true
dplyr::glimpse(engsoccerdata::spain)
```
\




## First function 

So the first function in our **`ussie`** package will turn these in to standard formats:

-   use only the common columns

-   give the same column the same data type

## Create a package

Be deliberate about where you create your package

Do not nest inside another RStudio project, R package or git repo.

\


üé¨ Create a package:

```{r}
usethis::create_package("~/Desktop/ussie")
```

## `create_package()`

What happens when we run `create_package()`?

-   R will create a folder called `ussie` which is a package and an RStudio project

-   restart R in the new project

-   create some infrastructure for your package

-   start the RStudio Build pane

::: aside
continued.....
:::

## `create_package()`

What happens when we run `create_package()`?

-   `ussie.Rproj`

-   `DESCRIPTION` provides metadata about your package.

-   The `R/` directory is where we will put `.R` files with function definitions.

-   `NAMESPACE` declares the functions your package exports and the functions your package imports from other packages.

::: aside
continued.....
:::

## `create_package()`

What happens when we run `create_package()`?

-   `.Rbuildignore` lists files that we need but that should not be included when building the R package from source.

-   `.gitignore` anticipates Git usage and ignores some standard, behind-the-scenes files created by R and RStudio.

## Make package a git repo

üé¨ Make your package a git repository

```{r}
usethis::use_git()
```

## 

```
v Initialising Git repo
v Adding '.Rhistory', '.Rdata', '.httr-oauth', '.DS_Store' to '.gitignore'
There are 5 uncommitted files:
* '.gitignore'
* '.Rbuildignore'
* 'DESCRIPTION'
* 'NAMESPACE'
* 'ussieprac.Rproj'
Is it ok to commit them?

1: Nope
2: Absolutely not
3: I agree
```
\

üé¨ Choose the option that means yes!

## 

```
v Adding files
v Making a commit with message 'Initial commit'
* A restart of RStudio is required to activate the Git pane
Restart now?

1: Negative
2: No way
3: Yeah
```

\

üé¨ Choose the option that means yes!

\

Your session will restart.

## Put a remote copy on GitHub

üé¨ Put on GitHub as a remote repository

```{r}
usethis::use_github()
```

##  {.smaller}

```
i Defaulting to 'https' Git protocol
v Setting active project to 'C:/Users/er13/OneDrive - University of York/Desktop/Desktop/ussieprac'

v Setting URL field in DESCRIPTION to 'https://github.com/3mmaRand/ussieprac'
v Setting BugReports field in DESCRIPTION to 'https://github.com/3mmaRand/ussieprac/issues'
There is 1 uncommitted file:
* 'DESCRIPTION'
Is it ok to commit it?

1: Negative
2: Yup
3: Not now
```

\

üé¨ Choose the option that means yes!

## 

```
v Adding files
v Making a commit with message 'Add GitHub links to DESCRIPTION'
v Pushing 'main' branch to GitHub and setting 'origin/main' as upstream branch
v Opening URL 'https://github.com/3mmaRand/ussieprac'
```

\

üé¨ Quick check with:

```{r}
usethis::git_sitrep()
```

## Add the first function

We will add `uss_make_matches()`

Functions will go in an `.R` file.

\

. . .

There's a `usethis` helper for adding `.R` files!

\

. . .

```{r}
usethis::use_r("file_name")
```

\

`usethis::use_r()` adds the file extension and saves in `R/` folder

## `usethis::use_r()`

üé¨ Create a new R file in your package called `uss_make_matches.R`

\

. . .

```{r}
usethis::use_r("uss_make_matches")
```

```
‚àö Setting active project to 'C:/Users/er13/Desktop/ussie'
‚Ä¢ Modify 'R/uss_make_matches.R'
‚Ä¢ Call \`use_test()\` to create a matching test file
```

\

. . .

We want to be able to use the function like this: `uss_make_matches(engsoccerdata::italy)`

## Add the function

üé¨ Put the following [code](intermediate/uss_make_matches.R) into your script:

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|3|4|5-12"
uss_make_matches <- function(data_engsoc) {
  result <-
    data_engsoc |>
    tibble::as_tibble() |>
    dplyr::transmute(
      tier = as.integer(tier),
      season = as.integer(Season),
      date = as.Date(Date),
      home = as.character(home),
      visitor = as.character(visitor),
      goals_home = as.integer(hgoal),
      goals_visitor = as.integer(vgoal)
    )
  result
}

```

# Test your function

## Development workflow

In a normal script you might use:

```{r}
source("R/uss_make_matches.R")
```

\

. . .

but when building packages we use a `devtools` approach

## Development workflow

![Development workflow](images/dev_cycle_before_testing.png){fig-alt="there are three boxes with arrow joining them clockwise. The boxes are (clockwise from 3' oclock) 'devtools::load_all() Cmd/Ctrl + Shift +L', 'Explore in console' and 'Modify code'" width="1200"}

# Load your package

## `devtools::load_all()`

üé¨ Load package with `devtools::load_all()`.

```{r}
devtools::load_all()
```

```{r}
Loading ussie
```

## Test

Test the `uss_make_matches()` function in the console.

```{r}
uss_make_matches(engsoccerdata::italy)
```

\

```

```

\ 

ü§î There's no column for the country - that could be confusing


## Update the function

üé¨ Change the function so it takes an additional argument which is the name of the country. The country name should be in column called "country". The aim is to use the function like this:


```{r}
uss_make_matches(engsoccerdata::spain, "Spain")
```


\

. . .

üé¨ Load with `devtools::load_all()` and test the updated function.



## An answer

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|1,6"
uss_make_matches <- function(data_engsoc, country) {
  result <-
    data_engsoc |>
    tibble::as_tibble() |>
    dplyr::transmute(
      country = as.character(country),
      tier = as.integer(tier),
      season = as.integer(Season),
      date = as.Date(Date),
      home = as.character(home),
      visitor = as.character(visitor),
      goals_home = as.integer(hgoal),
      goals_visitor = as.integer(vgoal)
    )
  result
}

```


# Check your package

## Check your package

`R CMD check` is the gold standard for checking that an R package is in full working order.

\

It is a programme that is executed in the shell.

\

However, `devtools` has the `check()` function to allow you to run this without leaving your R session.

## `devtools::check()`

üé¨ Check your package:

```{r}
devtools::check()
```

## `devtools::check()` {.smaller}


```

```

## Aside: in case of error

On running `devtools::check()` you may get an error if you are using a networked drive.

```
Updating ussie documentation  
Error: The specified file is not readable: path-to\ussie\NAMESPACE
```

\

This is covered [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40530968/overwriting-namespace-and-rd-with-roxygen2) and can be fixed.

## Aside: in case of error

Save a copy of this file:

[fix_for_networked_drives.R](https://forwards.github.io/workshops/package-dev-modules/slides/03-your-first-package/fix_for_networked_drives.R)

Save it somewhere other than the `ussie` directory

Open the file from the `ussie` project session

Run the whole file

You should now find that `devtools::check()` proceeds normally

# üì¶ Woo hooüì¶ <BR> You made a package!

## Summary {.smaller}

-   It is useful to make a package
    -   it is fairly easy with `devtools`
    -   it will help you work more reproducibly
-   Packages can be in one of 5 states:
    -   source - what you write
    -   bundled - source compressed to single file, submitted to CRAN
    -   binary - distribution for users w/o `devtools`
    -   installed - a binary that's been decompressed
    -   in-memory - installed package that has been loaded

## Summary continued {.smaller}

-   A minimal package comprises
    -   a folder which is a package and a RProj
    -   `DESCRIPTION`, `NAMESPACE`, `.Rbuildignore` `.gitignore`
    -   `R/` directory for functions
-   We add functions with `usethis:use_r()`
-   We use the package interactively with `devtools::load_all()`
-   We use `devtools::check()` to execute `R CMD` check
-   We add a license with `usethis::use_mit_license()`
